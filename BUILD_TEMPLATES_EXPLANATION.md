# Build Templates/Presets - What They Are

## 🎯 What Are Build Templates?

**Build Templates** (also called "Presets") are **pre-configured habitat setups** that users can select with one click instead of building from scratch.

Think of them like:
- **Recipe templates** - "Beginner Betta Setup" instead of choosing each ingredient
- **Car presets** - "Sport Mode" vs "Eco Mode" 
- **Game presets** - "Easy Mode" vs "Hard Mode"

## 💡 Why They're Valuable

### For Users:
- ✅ **Saves time** - One click vs 10+ selections
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** - No guesswork, just pick a template
- ✅ **Confidence** - Know it's a proven setup
- ✅ **Learning** - See what a "good" setup looks like

### For You:
- ✅ **Higher completion rates** - Users finish builds faster
- ✅ **More affiliate clicks** - More completed builds = more purchases
- ✅ **Premium feature** - Can charge for advanced templates
