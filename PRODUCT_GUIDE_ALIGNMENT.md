## ⚠️ **PRODUCTS THAT DON'T ALIGN WITH GUIDES**

### **1. CRITICAL: Calcium Sand (Leopard Gecko)**
**Issue:**
- Guide says: "Calcium sand is DANGEROUS and should NEVER be used"
- Current status: Available for "experienced" users (only blocked for beginners)
- Problem: Guide explicitly states it's dangerous for everyone, not just beginners

**Fix Needed:**
- Block calcium sand for ALL users (beginner and experienced)
- Add to restricted/unsafe list

### **2. HIGH PRIORITY: High-Flow Filter (Betta)**
**Issue:**
- Guide says: "Avoid high-flow filters - they create strong currents that stress bettas"
- Current status: Available with warning message
- Problem: Guide recommends avoiding them, but they're still selectable

**Fix Needed:**
- Either block high-flow filters entirely, OR
- Add stronger warning and make it harder to select
- Guide says "sponge filters are best" - consider making high-flow filters only available if user explicitly wants them

### **3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: HOB Filter (Betta)**
**Issue:**
- Guide says: "HOB filters can work if adjustable flow set to minimum"
- Current status: Available with "medium" flow
- Problem: Guide says they need to be adjustable and set to minimum, but there's no way to verify this

**Fix Needed:**
- Add note that HOB filters must have adjustable flow
- Consider adding a warning about flow control

## 📋 **RECOMMENDED FIXES**

### **Priority 1: Block Calcium Sand Completely**
Calcium sand is dangerous for ALL users, not just beginners. It should be completely blocked.

### **Priority 2: Block or Restrict High-Flow Filters**
High-flow filters stress bettas. Either block them or add a strong warning that requires user acknowledgment.

Add notes about adjustable flow requirements for HOB filters.
